# MineCord

Minecraft made it 3D

Terraria made it 2D

MineCord makes it 1D

# Commands (for me)

Activate Virtual Environment: myenv/Scripts/activate (type 'deactivate' to end)

# Order of Task (for me)

-> Create a class for equippables, and create each tool/armor

-> -> -> Each tool must have a score that contributes to how effective getting resources is 
-> -> -> (Explore relies on ALL) (Gather gets boost with axe/hoe) (hunt: sword or axe or bow or crossbow)

-> Implement crafting

-> Make things look nicer with embeds

-> Create a beautiful inventory png 

-> create bosses (Ender dragon, sea guardian) DEATH == RESTART

-> implement an enderchest & a way to revive past data?

# Ideas

-> When a new user tries to explore, tell them they dont make it very far, and dm them letting them know that they should work on getting some stronger gear / enchants before they can set off on more exciting journies.
